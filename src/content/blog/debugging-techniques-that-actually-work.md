Let's be honest: we all start with `console.log()`. But when that doesn't work (or when you have 47 console logs and forgot which is which), it's time to level up your debugging game.

## The Scientific Method (Yes, Really)

Debugging is just the scientific method in disguise:

1. **Observe** - What's actually happening?
2. **Hypothesize** - What do you think is causing it?
3. **Test** - Change one thing and check the result
4. **Repeat** - Until the bug surrenders

## Technique 1: Binary Search Your Code

Comment out half your code. Does the bug still happen?
- If yes: It's in the other half
- If no: It's in the commented half

Keep halving until you find the culprit. Works every time.

## Technique 2: The Debugger (Use It!)

I know, I know. Setting up the debugger feels like work. But trust me:

```javascript
// Instead of this...
console.log('user:', user);
console.log('user.profile:', user.profile);
console.log('user.profile.email:', user.profile?.email);

// Do this...
debugger; // One line. Inspect everything.
```

**VS Code tip:** Press F5, click in the margin to set breakpoints, and thank me later.

## Technique 3: Trace Backwards

Start from where the error appears and work backwards:
- What function called this?
- Where did this data come from?
- When was this variable last modified?

Stack traces are your friend, even if they look scary.

## Technique 4: Reproduce It Consistently

Random bugs are the worst. Before fixing, make it happen on command:
- What exact steps trigger it?
- Does it happen every time?
- Is it environment-specific?

A reproducible bug is 50% solved.

## Technique 5: Explain It to Someone (or Something)

Rubber duck debugging works because:
- You slow down and articulate the problem
- You catch assumptions
- You notice what you don't know

I have a rubber duck named Debug Dan. He's a great listener and never judges my code.

## Technique 6: Take a Break

Seriously. Sometimes the solution appears when you:
- Go for a walk
- Make coffee
- Think about anything else

Your brain keeps working in the background. It's like defragmenting your mental hard drive.

## The Nuclear Option: Delete and Rewrite

When nothing works:
1. Understand what the code should do
2. Delete it
3. Write it fresh

Often faster than debugging spaghetti code from 3am last Tuesday.

## Tools I Actually Use

- **Chrome DevTools** - Network tab is criminally underused
- **React DevTools** - For when props are acting sus
- **Postman** - Test APIs independently
- **Git bisect** - Find which commit broke everything

## The Golden Rule

**Change one thing at a time.** I know you want to fix all the things, but then when it works you won't know why.

## Conclusion

Good debugging is like being a detective. Gather evidence, test theories, and eventually you'll catch the bug. And when you do, write a test so it can't escape again.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have a null reference error to track down. Wish me luck.

Happy debugging! üêõüî®
