As developers, we're always learning. New frameworks drop monthly. Languages evolve. Tools change. Here's my systematic approach to learning tech without burning out.

## The Framework (30-60-90 Days)

### First 30 Days: Fundamentals

**Goal:** Understand the basics and build something small.

**Week 1: Overview**
- Read official docs (intro pages only)
- Watch 1-2 getting-started videos
- Understand: What problem does this solve?
- Install and run "Hello World"

**Week 2: Core Concepts**
- Learn the 5-7 most important concepts
- Build trivial examples for each
- Don't worry about best practices yet

**Week 3: Small Project**
- Build a TodoMVC equivalent
- Use official tutorials
- Ask questions in community Discord/Slack
- Struggle is normal

**Week 4: Review & Reinforce**
- What confused me?
- What clicked?
- Write a blog post explaining what I learned
- Share with community for feedback

### Days 30-60: Going Deeper

**Goal:** Build something real. Hit limitations.

**Pick a project that:**
- Solves a real problem for you
- Requires multiple features
- Will take 2-4 weeks
- Uses the technology's strengths

**Learn:**
- State management
- Data fetching
- Error handling
- Testing basics
- Deployment

**Don't learn yet:**
- Advanced patterns
- Performance optimization
- Every edge case

### Days 60-90: Advanced & Mastery

**Goal:** Understand trade-offs and best practices.

**Now learn:**
- Architecture patterns
- Performance considerations
- Common pitfalls
- When NOT to use this tech
- Alternative approaches

**Contribute:**
- Answer questions
- File bug reports
- Improve docs
- Build a library/tool

By day 90, you're not an expert. But you're productive.

## My Learning Stack

### 1. Official Docs First

Always start here. They're usually better than tutorials.

**What I read:**
- Quick start
- Core concepts
- API reference (as needed)

**What I skip:**
- Advanced guides (for now)
- Migration guides
- Internal architecture

### 2. Build While Learning

**Don't:**
- Watch 40 hours of tutorials before coding
- Read entire book first
- Try to understand everything

**Do:**
- Follow tutorial, then modify it
- Build something immediately
- Break things and fix them

### 3. Join the Community

**Where I hang out:**
- Official Discord/Slack
- Reddit (r/javascript, r/reactjs, etc.)
- Twitter/X (follow core maintainers)
- GitHub Discussions

**Pro tip:** Lurk for a week. Understand culture before asking questions.

### 4. Read Other People's Code

**Best sources:**
- Official examples
- Popular open source projects
- Starter templates
- Netlify/Vercel templates

**What I look for:**
- Project structure
- Common patterns
- How they handle errors
- Testing approaches

### 5. Take Notes (Obsidian)

I keep a note for each technology:

```markdown
# React

## Core Concepts
- Components
- Props
- State
- Hooks

## Gotchas
- useEffect dependencies
- Key prop in lists
- ...

## Useful Resources
- [Official Docs](...)
- [Tutorial X](...)

## My Questions
- When to use useCallback?
- ...
```

Searchable, linkable, forever.

## The Projects I Build

### Level 1: Todo App

Yes, everyone builds this. For good reason:
- CRUD operations
- State management
- User input
- Local storage

**Variations:**
- Todo app with API
- Todo app with auth
- Todo app with real-time updates

### Level 2: Dashboard

**Features:**
- Data visualization
- API integration
- Multiple views
- Filtering/sorting

**Good for learning:**
- Data fetching
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Performance

### Level 3: Mini-SaaS

**Features:**
- Authentication
- Database
- Payments (Stripe)
- Email
- Deployment

**This teaches:**
- Full-stack integration
- Real-world concerns
- Production deployment
- User experience

## Specific Strategies

### Learning a New Language

**My order:**
1. Syntax and types
2. Control flow
3. Functions
4. Data structures
5. OOP/FP concepts
6. Standard library
7. Ecosystem/tooling

**Project:** CLI tool or web scraper

### Learning a Framework

**My order:**
1. Project setup
2. Component model
3. State management
4. Routing
5. Data fetching
6. Forms
7. Testing

**Project:** CRUD app with API

### Learning a Tool

**My order:**
1. What problem does it solve?
2. Basic usage
3. Configuration options
4. Integration with my workflow
5. Advanced features

**Project:** Improve existing project with this tool

## When I Get Stuck

### Strategy 1: Rubber Duck It

Explain the problem out loud. 50% of the time, I solve it mid-explanation.

### Strategy 2: The 15-Minute Rule

Stuck for 15 minutes? Ask for help.

**Where I ask:**
- Stack Overflow (searchable forever)
- Discord/Slack (fast responses)
- GitHub Issues (if it's a bug)

### Strategy 3: Take a Break

Seriously. Walk away. The answer comes.

### Strategy 4: Work on Something Else

Stalled on Feature A? Work on Feature B. Come back fresh.

## Learning from Mistakes

**My approach:**
1. Make the mistake
2. Break the code
3. Figure out why
4. Write a test to prevent it
5. Never make it again

Mistakes are expensive lessons. Don't waste them.

## Resources I Actually Use

### Courses
- **Egghead.io** - Short, focused videos
- **Frontend Masters** - Deep dives
- **Free Code Camp** - When free matters

### Blogs
- Official blogs (best source)
- Dev.to (hit or miss, but free)
- Personal blogs (often hidden gems)

### Books
- I rarely read cover-to-cover
- I use as reference
- "You Don't Know JS" series = excellent

### YouTube
- **Fireship** - Quick overviews
- **Theo** - Opinions and insights
- **Ben Awad** - Real coding, not tutorials

## How I Stay Current

### Newsletter Strategy

I subscribe to:
- **JavaScript Weekly**
- **React Status**
- **Node Weekly**
- **Frontend Focus**

Skim headlines. Read what interests me. Archive rest.

### Twitter/X

Follow:
- Library/framework creators
- Prolific open source devs
- Tech companies
- Conference speakers

Turn off notifications. Check once daily.

### RSS Feeds

Still use them! Curated list of:
- Official blogs
- My favorite devs
- Tech publications

Read during lunch or commute.

## The Most Important Lesson

**You don't need to learn everything.**

- You can't keep up with all of JS ecosystem
- You don't need every new framework
- It's okay to wait and see

**Learn what:**
- You need for work
- Genuinely interests you
- Solves your problems

Ignore the rest. FOMO is a trap.

## My Learning Routine

**Daily (30 min):**
- Read newsletters
- Quick tutorial or doc page
- Experiment with something small

**Weekly (2-3 hours):**
- Build on side project
- Watch a conference talk
- Read a technical article

**Monthly:**
- Start learning something new
- Contribute to open source
- Write about what I learned

**Yearly:**
- Review what I learned
- Identify gaps
- Plan next year

## Signs You're Learning Wrong

- Watching tutorials but not coding
- Reading about concepts but not using them
- Collecting resources but not consuming them
- Feeling guilty about what you don't know

## Signs You're Learning Right

- Building things
- Breaking things
- Fixing things
- Sharing things
- Teaching things

## Conclusion

Learning tech isn't about being smart. It's about being systematic:

1. **Start small** - Don't overwhelm yourself
2. **Build stuff** - Knowledge without practice is useless
3. **Share learnings** - Teaching solidifies understanding
4. **Be patient** - Expertise takes time

Remember: Everyone was a beginner once. Even that person whose code you admire struggled with the basics.

Now go learn something new! ðŸ“š
